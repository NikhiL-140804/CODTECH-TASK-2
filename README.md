# COLLABORATIVE DESIGN WORKFLOW

COMPANY: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

NAME: MVR NIKHIL

INTERN ID: CT04DG2841

DOMAIN: FIGMA WEB DEVELOPMENT

DURATION: 4 WEEKS

MENTOR: NEELA SANTOSH

DESCRIPTION:

As part of Task 2 of my internship, I was required to simulate a real-world team collaboration scenario using Figma, demonstrating features like commenting, sharing, and version control. The aim was to replicate how professional teams work on design files in a collaborative environment, communicate feedback, and manage multiple iterations efficiently. I used Figma, a cloud-based vector design and prototyping platform that allows real-time collaboration, commenting, and team-based workflows, making it an industry-standard tool for designers and product teams. This task helped me explore how Figma supports feedback-driven design processes and maintains transparency and accountability across design updates.

To begin, I created a multi-frame design project that mimicked a team working together on a UI layout. I then shared the design file with team members (real or simulated) using Figma’s Share functionality. I gave specific roles and access rights — “Can Edit” for contributors and “Can View/Comment” for reviewers — showcasing how different roles interact with the design process. I simulated collaboration by adding comments directly on the canvas, pointing to specific UI elements like headers, buttons, icons, and layout issues. These comments represented typical design feedback, such as “adjust padding,” “change font size,” and “update icon to a more minimal style.” I responded to those comments, marked some as resolved, and left others open to simulate ongoing discussion.

Additionally, I showcased version control by using Figma’s Version History feature. I created deliberate changes over time — such as updating colors, repositioning elements, and modifying components — and saved each stage as a named version (e.g., “Initial Draft,” “Feedback Applied,” “Final Touches”). This allowed me to show how designers can revert to earlier versions if needed and compare iterations. I also used the Auto Layout feature to demonstrate how collaborative teams maintain consistency in spacing and responsiveness, and I grouped UI elements logically to make shared editing easier and more structured.

This task helped me understand the importance of non-linear design processes — where feedback, edits, and improvements often happen in cycles rather than straight lines. I also practiced explaining design choices visually and verbally through the comment system. For example, rather than only changing a button, I would annotate why I changed it and how that improved user experience, mimicking real-world client-designer communication.

From a technical standpoint, I used tools such as Figma’s comment tool, share links with view/comment/edit permissions, and named version history for structured documentation. I also worked with typography tools, layout grids, and color styles to reflect how a real team aligns on design systems. Through this task, I learned that good collaboration is not just about sharing files — it's about clarity, iteration, and structure. Effective feedback, version control, and clean design documentation ensure everyone on the team stays aligned and productive. Task 2 has been invaluable in helping me simulate a real collaborative workflow, which is essential for any design role in the industry.
